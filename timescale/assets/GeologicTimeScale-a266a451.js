The Quaternary is notable for the evolution and spread of Homo sapiens, who have had an unprecedented impact on the global ecosystem through agriculture, urbanization, and the exploitation of natural resources. Significant extinctions of large mammals and other species have occurred during this period, often associated with human activity.

The Holocene is marked by the dominance of humans over the Earth's ecosystems, leading to widespread environmental changes through deforestation, pollution, and the alteration of natural landscapes. Additionally, this epoch has witnessed significant biodiversity loss and the ongoing Sixth Mass Extinction, driven by human activity.

The Hadean ended 4.031 billion years ago and was succeeded by the Archean eon, with the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesized to have occurred at the Hadean-Archean boundary.","Hadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of granular zircons from one locality (Jack Hills) in Western Australia. Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: it appears that plate tectonics and the growth of continents may have started in the Hadean. Earth in the early Hadean had a very thick carbon dioxide- and methane-rich prebiotic atmosphere, but eventually oceans made of liquid water were formed."]},hu=(e,n)=>P.createElement("svg",{xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",xmlnsXlink:"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink",x:"0px",y:"0px",viewBox:"0 0 256 256",enableBackground:"new 0 0 256 256",xmlSpace:"preserve",ref:n,...e},P.createElement("metadata",null," Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon "),P.createElement("g",null,P.createElement("g",null,P.createElement("g",null,P.createElement("path",{fill:"#000000",d:"M121.8,10.6c-13.3,2.9-23.3,15.2-23.3,28.8c0,8.8,4.6,17.9,11.8,23.3l3,2.2v16.7v16.7H96.9c-18,0-23.3,0.4-31,2.3c-30.8,7.8-52.8,33.5-55.6,65.3c-3.6,39.5,25.8,75.2,65.5,79.5c6.5,0.7,97.9,0.7,104.4,0c26.7-2.9,50.2-20.5,60.2-45.2c17-41.9-6.6-88.6-50.3-99.6c-7.6-1.9-12.9-2.3-31-2.3h-16.4V81.7V64.9l3-2.2c7.2-5.4,11.8-14.5,11.8-23.3c0-1.3-0.3-4-0.7-5.9C153.5,17.5,137.8,7.2,121.8,10.6z M179.8,128.6c9.2,1.6,16.9,5.6,23.7,12.4c6.8,6.8,10.8,14.5,12.4,23.7c1.3,7.6,0.6,15.4-2.1,22.9c-4.2,11.6-14.6,22-26.2,26.2c-7.8,2.8-7.1,2.8-59.6,2.8c-52.5,0-51.9,0-59.7-2.8c-11.6-4.2-22-14.6-26.2-26.2c-9.3-25.6,6-53.1,32.8-58.8c3.6-0.7,7.5-0.8,52.4-0.8C168.4,127.9,176.5,128,179.8,128.6z"}),P.createElement("path",{fill:"#000000",d:"M80.2,157.9c-2.2,0.6-6.1,2.9-7.4,4.3c-2.6,3-3.6,5.9-3.6,9.8c0,3.3,0.1,4.1,1.5,6.8c2.5,5.2,7.1,7.9,13,8c2.8,0,4-0.2,6-1.2c5.4-2.5,8.5-7.4,8.5-13.3c0-5.9-2.8-10.5-7.8-13C87.3,157.7,83,157.1,80.2,157.9z"}),P.createElement("path",{fill:"#000000",d:"M168.8,157.9c-2.2,0.6-6.1,2.9-7.4,4.3c-2.6,3-3.6,5.9-3.6,9.8c0,3.3,0.1,4.1,1.5,6.8c2.5,5.2,7.1,7.9,13,8c2.8,0,4-0.2,6-1.2c5.4-2.5,8.5-7.4,8.5-13.3c0-5.9-2.8-10.5-7.8-13C175.9,157.7,171.6,157.1,168.8,157.9z"}))))),du=P.forwardRef(hu),uu=({division:e})=>{const n=cu[e.node.id];return p.jsxs(mu,{children:[p.jsxs(fu,{children:[p.jsx(gu,{children:"Overview"}),e.node.id!=="0"&&p.jsx(pu,{children:p.jsx(du,{})})]}),n?p.jsx("div",{children:n.map((i,t)=>p.jsxs(R,{$margin:n.length>0&&t!==0?"8px 0 0 0":"",children:[i,t===n.length-1&&e.node.id!=="0"&&p.jsx("sup",{children:"[4]"})]},`paragraph_${t}`))}):p.jsx("p",{children:"Coming soon"})]})},fu=N.div`
